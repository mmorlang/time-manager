#### Current App Summary

##### Run Status
- Currently,the app will build and run with all the UI/buttons in place as well as the recycler views.
- The app is not currently able to pull the data, but it is prepared to display it.

##### Bugs
- A known bug at the moment is when I add the code for my "check for apps" method, the apps will display at the start up but then it has conflicts with the actual time manager app.
So code was commented/taken out to get it to run properly.
##### Cosmetic Views
- I'd like to add a lot more accents and details, so my pages don't look so bland.

##### Stretch Goals
- Checking for the current apps on the device was partially a last minute stretch goal I'd like to look further into.
- Being able to link time frames across multiple devices.
